# Glossary

Allows you to specify terms and their respective definitions to be displayed as annotations. Based on those terms, GitBook will automatically build an index and highlight those terms in pages.

允许您指定术语和它们各自的定义，以作为注释显示。基于这些条款，GitBook将自动建立索引并在页面中突出这些项

The `GLOSSARY.md` format is a list of `h2` headings, along with a description paragraph:

```markdown
## Term
Definition for this term

## Another term
With it's definition, this can contain bold text
and all other kinds of inline markup ...
```
